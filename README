= plistifier-rails3

Rough pass at a Rails 3 initializer that enables rendering plists from controllers.
This code was borrowed and heavily modified from jeena's original plistifier plugin
for Rails 2 (see http://github.com/jeena/plistifier).

== Installation

This initializer relies on CFPropertyList so make sure you add the gem to your Gemfile
before copying plistifier.rb into config/initializers. CFPropertyList provides the
#to_plist method that this initializer attempts to call on your data.

== Usage

Your ActiveRecord models will also need #to_hash methods defined on them. These hashes
should contain the name/value pairs to include in the plist. For example:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    def to_hash
      { "firstName" => first_name, "lastName" => last_name }
    end
  end

And here's an example of how to render a plist from a controller:

  class ApiController < ApplicationController
    def get_users
      users = User.all
      render :plist => users
    end
  end
